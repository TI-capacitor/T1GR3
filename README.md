# üìå ROS 2 Setup Guide for Running `ros2` Commands

If you encounter the error:

```
ros2: command not found
```

it means your ROS 2 environment is not sourced. Follow these steps to fix it:

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Activate Your Virtual Environment**
Before running any ROS 2 commands, ensure you're inside your virtual environment:

```bash
cd ~/template_ws
source env/bin/activate
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Source Your ROS 2 Installation**
### **For ROS 2 Jazzy (Ubuntu 24.04)**
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

### **For Other ROS 2 Distros (e.g., Humble, Rolling, etc.)**
```bash
source /opt/ros/<your-distro>/setup.bash
```
Replace `<your-distro>` with your actual ROS 2 version.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Your ROS 2 Workspace**
If you‚Äôve built your workspace (`template_ws`), you need to source it as well:

```bash
source ~/template_ws/install/setup.bash
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify That ROS 2 is Available**
Run the following command to check if ROS 2 is correctly set up:

```bash
ros2 doctor
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see a summary of your ROS 2 environment.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your ROS 2 Command Again**
Now, you should be able to launch your drone script:

```bash
ros2 launch ros_gz_example_bringup autonomous_drone.launch.py
```

üöÄ **Your ROS 2 environment is now properly set up!**
